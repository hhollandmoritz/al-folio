Scientists are regularly called upon to exercise our creativity in identifying problems, new ideas, and finding creative solutions to those problems. Although this is a critical part of our job we have little formal training in the generation of new ideas or efficient techniques to link disparate concepts and come up with innovative ideas in short amounts of time. Luckily, techniques to enhance creative thinking can be taught and our friends in the fields of Design and Art have been training students in them for years. Below are materials inspired by those disciplines to help train scientists to think creatively.


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col three left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
</div>
